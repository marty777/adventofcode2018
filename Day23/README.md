# Advent of Code 2018 - Day 23

## Usage
```
Day23 input.txt
```

## Notes
The sample data from the program description is included (as sample.txt) as well as my copy of the full size puzzle input.

The implementation for part 2 uses very slow gradient decent that produced the correct result for my input (after several hours) but is probably not viable as a general solution.
